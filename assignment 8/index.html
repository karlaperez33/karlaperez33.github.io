  <h2> The opening night of the star's Eras Tour traversed her 10-album career, revisiting crossover hits, rowdier experiments and more restrained singer-songwriter material.</h2>

  <p>GLENDALE, Ariz. — The most meaningful Taylor Swift recording of the past few years is almost certainly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/15/arts/music/taylor-swift-all-too-well.html"> "All Too Well (10 Minute Version) (Taylor's Version) (From the Vault),”</a> as layered and provocative as its title is unwieldy. A revision and expansion of one of her most gutting songs — the original appears on her 2012 breakthrough pop album, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/28/arts/music/no-more-kid-stuff-for-taylor-swift.html"> "Red"</a>— it dissects a problematic, lopsided and ultimately scarring relationship with forensic detail. It's a scathing commentary on the ex who inspired the track, and it also has something to say about the version of Swift who first committed this story to song over a decade ago: Swift now understands things that Swift then couldn't possibly have known.</p>


  <p>Around halfway through Swift's three-hour performance at State Farm Stadium here on Friday — the opening night of the Eras Tour, her first roadshow in five years — she was at the center of the long runway stage, elevated on a platform, holding 70,000 people rapt with this tale of righteous fury and anguish. Plenty were singing along with her, but somehow, the accumulated voices sounded like one huge hush, students in awe of the master class.</p>
  <p>There were plenty of peaks during this concert drawn from the full arc of Swift's career — the first of a sold-out 52-date national tour that made news for its <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/17/arts/music/taylor-swift-tickets-ticketmaster.html"> disastrous rollout of ticket sales</a> — but none quite like this. Throughout the night, she zigzagged between stretches of high-octane hits from older albums and mixed-bag selections from more recent ones — celebration with splashes of duty. What this ambitious and energetic if sometimes scattershot performance underscored, however, was just how many pivots Swift has undertaken in her career, and how the accompanying risks can have wildly different consequences.</p>

  <p>In modern pop parlance, album rollouts are often described as eras, but Swift's career hasn't always been that cleanly delineated. She's made a few key turns over the years, though — on “Red,” when she divebombed into gleaming, centrist pop; on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/09/arts/music/taylor-swift-reputation-review.html">"Reputation,"</a> when she made some of her sleekest and most au courant music; and on  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/26/arts/music/taylor-swift-folklore-review.html"> "Folklore"</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/11/arts/music/taylor-swift-evermore-review.html">"Evermore,"</a> when she transformed into a woodland fairy.</p>
  <p>Songs from “Red,” one of Swift's most acclaimed albums, arrived mid-show, and they were potent wallops — a jubilant and cheeky “22” followed by the indignant “We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together” and “I Knew You Were Trouble.” And when Swift, in a one-legged bodysuit embroidered with a snake motif, performed selections from “Reputation,” she showed just how wrongly maligned that album was upon its release. “Don't Blame Me” was husky and alluring, while “Look What You Made Me Do,” performed in front of dancers trapped in glass boxes dressed as old versions of Swift, brimmed with attitude.</p>
  <p>Swift was cheerily, proactively defensive about “Evermore” — “an album I absolutely love despite what some of you say on TikTok” — but that segment of the show was particularly limp, especially the gloomy and spare “Marjorie” and “'Tis the Damn Season.” And the jolt from the melancholia of that restrained singer-songwriter release to the brazen stomp of “Reputation” was awkward. Songs from “Folklore” fared slightly better, especially “Cardigan” and “Betty,” but this section teetered toward melodrama, as if compensating for the less assured production on those songs.</p>
  <p>The set list over-indexed on the four albums Swift released after her <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/09/arts/music/taylor-swift-reputation-tour-review.html">last major tour</a>, supporting “Reputation” in 2018 — the chipper and jaunty <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/23/arts/music/taylor-swift-lover-review.html">"Lover,"</a> the one-two bucolic swaddle of “Folklore” and “Evermore,” and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/21/arts/music/taylor-swift-midnights-review.html"> "Midnights,"</a> released last October. But the Eras conceit also meant that Swift wouldn't have to exclusively lean on songs from these albums, which have in general been less popular, consistent and ambitious than her earlier ones.</p>
  <p>She opened the show with a run of songs from “Lover,” a hit-or-miss album that still yielded some excellent tracks. “The Man,” performed in full office cosplay, was biting and hilarious, and “Cruel Summer” had an almost ecstatic chill to it. From there, she jumped back to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/09/arts/music/09cara.html"> "Fearless,"</a> her second album, and the first one made with an understanding that her relationship with country music might only be a dalliance. The earnest pleas in “You Belong With Me” and “Love Story” still had their old bite.</p>
